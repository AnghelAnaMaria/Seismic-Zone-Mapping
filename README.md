# Interactive Map Project

## Description
This project is an **interactive map** built with **JavaScript, Node.js, Python, HTML, and CSS**. It displays markers for specific locations defined in a dataset, which is processed using **Python and Pandas** before being visualized on the map. Users can view points of interest and interact with them.

The project uses a **mapping API (Google Maps)** to render and manage the markers and **Node.js with a geocoding library** to convert addresses into coordinates automatically. Its main goal is to provide a **clear and interactive visualization of predefined locations**, with the ability to preprocess and manage location data efficiently.

## Features
- Preprocess location data using **Python and Pandas**  
- Geocode addresses into coordinates using **Node.js and Geocoder**  
- Display multiple markers on an interactive map  
- Easy to add or remove locations by modifying the dataset  
- Interactive map experience for users  

## Technologies
- **Python & Pandas** (for data handling)  
- **Node.js & Geocoder** (for address-to-coordinate conversion)  
- **JavaScript** (for map interactivity)  
- **HTML & CSS**  
- **Google Maps API**
